      *****************************************************************
      * Loop through the sentence one word at a time until: 
      *
      *    1. All words in the sentence are processed or 
      *    2. We have filled the table holding the words or
      *    3. We have at least one word and the previous word
      *             is not all spaces indicating no more words are
      *                               in the sentence
      *
      * Each time through the loop:
      *
      *    1. Have UNSTRING find the next space in the sentence
      *       starting at the position in the WS-Word-Pointer POINTER.
      *       (UNSTRING will update WS-WORD-Pointer to the position
      *                 after the space it found automagically)
      *
      *    2. UNSTRING will move the word it found into the 
      *       WS-Words-In-Sentence table using Sentence-Word_Numeber
      *       as the index into WS-Words-In-Sentence table.

      *       When UNSTRING reaches the end of the sentence,
