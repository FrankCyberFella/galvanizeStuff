# Data access part 2 lecture

## Problem statement

In the previous unit, the students learned about the DAO pattern and how to read data from a database through DAO classes. However, applications often have requirements to add, update, and remove data too. Applications may also encounter errors and throw exceptions when working with a database, an application needs to handle these exceptions to recover gracefully and not crash.

## Overview of session

The students learned how they can read data from a SQL database. Today they'll learn how to write application code to run `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements. They'll also learn about exception handling in a DAO method.

## Session objectives

* How to handle exceptions in a Data Access Object class.
* Run SQL `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements from a C# application.
* Read data returned from an `INSERT` statement using `OUTPUT`.
