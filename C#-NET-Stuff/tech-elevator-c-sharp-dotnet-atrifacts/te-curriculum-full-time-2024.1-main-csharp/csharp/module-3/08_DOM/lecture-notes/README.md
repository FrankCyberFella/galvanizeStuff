# DOM Lecture
##### (2018-06-18)

## Overview of Session

The JavaScript that you write is mainly working with the browser's UI. That UI is modeled in the DOM or the Document Object Model. There are many JavaScript functions you can learn to work with the DOM and manipulate it so you can change the look and functions of the page your JavaScript is running in.

To do this, it's also important to understand what the DOM is and how it's different from the HTML you're sending to the browser.

## Session Objectives

- Describe the difference between the DOM and HTML
- Select elements from the DOM using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`
- Describe the DOM and how it's structured (tree)
- Set `innerText` on HTML elements
- Describe why `innerHTML` can be dangerous
- Create new DOM elements using `createElement()` and `insertAdjacentElement()`
- Traverse the DOM
- Investigate the living DOM in the browser
