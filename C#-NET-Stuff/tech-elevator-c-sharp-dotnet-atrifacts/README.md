* **module 3** - Front-End - HTTP - REST - Writing and consuming APIs
* **final-capstone** - a two week long project chosen from a list of options develeoped as an Agile team

Each module has a set of digital artifacts stored:

* **LMS** - Each topic has a required reading assignmeng in the LMS to give them a basic introduction/understanding of a topic.  Students are expected to complete the reading and the associated tutorial before the night before a topic is taught.
Details of the topic and clearing up any confusion from the tutorial is done in the instructor led code along training session.

* **topic folder** containing:

    - **README.md** - Overview of the topic
    - **lecture** folder - starter code for instructor led code along to teach the topic
    - **lecture-notes folder** - notes for the instructor containing topic details and examples of how it may be taught

    - **exercise-final folder** - a solution to the exercises given to the students 2 days after the assignment due date
    - **tutorial folder** - an assignment the student is expected to complete after doing the tutorial in the LMS and before the lecture on the topic
    - **tutorial-final folder** - a solution to the tutorial assignment which is given to the students before the start of the lecture on the topic.  Some instructors used this as a review of what they learned in the tutorial. 

    * Most folders contain a README describing how the folder is expected to be used. *

* **reources** folder - contains suppemental files and scripts used in the curriculum

## Suggested use for Galvanize Team to "get up to speed" on C#

* If you are new to C#: 
    * reading the *tutorial* for a topic in the LMS will acquaint you with how that topic is implemented in C#/.Net
    * Review the code in the *tutorial-final* folder to see how the basic features of a topic are implemented
    * Review the *lecture-notes* for a topic to get additional details on the topic
    * While reviewing the *lecture-notes*, also relate them to what is coded on the *lecture-final* code to reinforce the topic

* If you are refeshing your knowledge, perform the steps above for the topics you want to refresh
